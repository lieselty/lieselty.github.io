I am passionate about using computational tools to explore biological questions, with a particular interest in metagenomics, RNA-seq analysis, and biological systems modeling.  
Currently working on the metagenomic analysis of the ocular surface in relation to contact lens use.

## 🧬 Projects

### Ocular Metagenome Analysis
**Master's thesis at Inselspital, Bern**  
- Investigating how contact lenses affect the microbial diversity of the ocular surface.
- Find a way to remove contaminant from low density metagenome.

### Metagenomic Profiling with sourmash
**Research project in Falquet’s Group, University of Fribourg**  
- Analyzed microbial community structures using sketching-based approaches.
- Used sourmash to test its functionalities and outputs compared to Kraken2.

### [Assembly and annotation of A. thaliana](https://github.com/lieselty/assembly-annotation-course)
**Small project at Universities Bern (Assembly) and Fribourg (Annotation)**
- Compute and compare different assemblies of the same genome with three assemblers (Fly, LJA, Hifiasm).
- Annotate one of them, focus on TEs (EDTA).

### [Gene Expression Changes in Toxoplasma-infected Mus musculus](https://github.com/lieselty/RNA_seq_course)
**Based on Singhania et al. (2019), at University Bern**
- RNA-sequencing analysis of healthy and T- gondii infected mice.
- Use of DESeq2 in R.

### [Computational Epidemiology project](https://github.com/lieselty/computational_epidemiology_project)
***University Bern***
- Analysis of SARS 2003 dataset

### Fungicide Resistance Study
**PBL Bioinformatics Project, University of Neuchâtel**  
- Explored climate adaptation and fungicide resistance in *Zymoseptoria tritici*.
- Conducted statistical analysis and data visualization using R.
