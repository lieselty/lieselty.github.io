## Projects

### 👁️ [Ocular Surface Microbiome Analysis](https://github.com/lieselty/OSM)
**Master's thesis at Inselspital, Bern (02.25-08.25)**  
- Investigating how contact lenses and pollen allergy affect the microbial communities of the ocular surface and tear proteome.
- Find a way to remove contaminant from low density metagenome.

### 🧬 Metagenomic Profiling with sourmash
**Research project in Falquet’s Group, University of Fribourg (Summer 2024)**  
- Analyzed microbial community structures using sketching-based approaches.
- Used sourmash to test its functionalities and outputs compared to Kraken2.

### 🌱 [Assembly and annotation of A. thaliana](https://github.com/lieselty/assembly-annotation-course)
**Small project at Universities Bern (Assembly) and Fribourg (Annotation) (Autumn 2024)**
- Compute and compare different assemblies of the same genome with three assemblers (Fly, LJA, Hifiasm).
- Annotate one of them, focus on TEs (EDTA).

### 🐭 [Gene Expression Changes in Toxoplasma-infected Mus musculus](https://github.com/lieselty/RNA_seq_course)
**Based on Singhania et al. (2019) paper, at University Bern (Autumn 2023)**
- RNA-sequencing analysis of healthy and T- gondii infected mice.
- Use of DESeq2 in R.

### 💊 [Computational Epidemiology project](https://github.com/lieselty/computational_epidemiology_project)
***University Bern (Autumn 2023)***
- Analysis of SARS 2003 dataset

### 🍄‍🟫 Fungicide Resistance Study
**PBL Bioinformatics Project, University of Neuchâtel (Spring 2023)**  
- Explored climate adaptation and fungicide resistance in *Zymoseptoria tritici*.
- Conducted statistical analysis and data visualization using R.
