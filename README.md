I am passionate about using computational tools to explore biological questions, with a particular interest in metagenomics, RNA-seq analysis, and biological systems modeling.  
Currently working on the metagenomic analysis of the ocular surface in relation to contact lens use.

## 🧬 Projects

### Ocular Metagenome Analysis
**Master's thesis at Inselspital, Bern**  
- Investigating how contact lenses affect the microbial diversity of the ocular surface.
- Developing and applying a metagenomic data analysis pipeline (Python, R, HPC).

### Metagenomic Profiling with sourmash
**Research project in Falquet’s Group, University of Fribourg**  
- Analyzed microbial community structures using sketching-based approaches.
- Used sourmash to compare environmental sample similarities.

### Fungicide Resistance Study]
**PBL Bioinformatics Project, University of Neuchâtel**  
- Explored climate adaptation and fungicide resistance in *Zymoseptoria tritici*.
- Conducted statistical analysis and data visualization using R.
